		<label>gene printing</label>
		<description>It took a lot of time and manpower to develop the xenogenes seen as commonplace in the galaxy today. Replicating that in your small colony would be impossible - but fortunately, you don’t have to, as 99% of the work has already been done for you. This research will allow you to create a Gene Printer, gene goop, and genes with a complexity level of 0 or 1.</description>
